# Pkgpanda: The DCOS Package manager

While most things can run in containers on top of mesos, using whatever fetching mechanism

# Major features

1. Ability to have multiple versions of a package ready for use simultaneously on a host.
2. No notion of modifying existing state. A package is either active (all its state alive), or not.
