# IP Detect Script 
The DCOS cluster relies on hosts knowing how to get their own IP on which DCOS should communicate to other hosts within the cluster. Since hosts tend to have more than a single IP address, it's vital that each deployment has a way to know which IP to use. The ip-detect script, though tricky to implement, solves this self-discovery problem.

## Example CentOS 7x

## Example Ubuntu 15x
